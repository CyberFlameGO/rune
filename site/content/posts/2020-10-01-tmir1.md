Less then one month ago [I announced Rune on Reddit]. And the response so far
has been amazing.

In this post I'll detail the developments that have happened in the Language
since its initial announcement.

## Macros

We taught Rune how to parse and execute macros. Macros are procedures which
takes one token stream to produce another. The produced token stream is then
introduced in the syntax tree of your program and included in the compilation.

This is of course, *quite complicated*. You have to take care that macro
expansion happens in a manner that is well integrated into the rest of the
compilation. Too early, and the items produces in the macro can't see imports.
Too late, and it can't produce them.

In Rune support is currently *experimental*. This restricts macros to only be
allowed in native modules. This makes things somewhat easier, because native
modules are written in Rust. And you get around the issue that you have to
compile the macro before you can run it. Macros are currently only provided by
the [`rune-experimental` crate].

We've learned a lot about macros from Rust. Rune parsing has been designed in a
way so that it can be used with macros, similarly to what you get through the
[`syn` crate]. We also provide our own version of the [`quote!` macro] to
perform quasi-quoting when producing tokens.

The following is an example macro that comes with the `std::experiments` crate,
that performs "stringy math":

```rust
use rune::ast;
use rune::Resolve as _;
use rune::{quote, MacroContext, Parser, Spanned, TokenStream};

/// Implementation for the `stringy_math!` macro.
pub(crate) fn stringy_math(
    ctx: &mut MacroContext,
    stream: &TokenStream,
) -> runestick::Result<TokenStream> {
    let mut parser = Parser::from_token_stream(stream);

    let mut output = quote!(ctx => 0);

    while !parser.is_eof()? {
        let op = parser.parse::<ast::Ident>()?;
        let arg = parser.parse::<ast::Expr>()?;

        output = match op.macro_resolve(ctx)?.as_ref() {
            "add" => quote!(ctx => (#output) + #arg),
            "sub" => quote!(ctx => (#output) - #arg),
            "div" => quote!(ctx => (#output) / #arg),
            "mul" => quote!(ctx => (#output) * #arg),
            _ => {
                return Err(From::from(runestick::SpannedError::msg(
                    op.span(),
                    "unsupported operation",
                )));
            }
        }
    }

    parser.parse_eof()?;
    Ok(output)
}
```

You can see it in action here:

{% rune(footnote = "Use of the stringy_math! macro", options = "macros=true", experimental = true) %}
use std::experiments::stringy_math;

fn main() {
    let value = stringy_math!(add 10 sub 5);
    println(`result: {value}`);
}
{% end %}

## `const` evaluation

Work has been started to support *`const` evaluation*. Constant evaluation
similarly to macros perform work at compile time, to produce values which are
literals embedded in the compiled code.

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn greeting(name) {
    `Hello {name}`
}

const GREETINGS = [
    greeting("Stranger"),
    greeting("Jane"),
    greeting("John"),
    greeting("Mio"),
];

fn main() {
    let rng = rand::WyRand::new();
    let greetings = GREETINGS;

	println(greetings[rng.int_range(0, greetings.len())]);
}
{% end %}

Usually all work is compiled at runtime through the bytecode-based virtual
machine, but constant evaluation introduces a subset of the language which can
be run and evaluated at compile time.

This currently includes:
* Numerical computations (floats and numbers).
* Simple control flow through `if`, `while`, and `loop`.
* A number of binary operators.
* String templates.
* ... and more

As a bonus, here's the fibonacci default example, as a constant function:

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn fib(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        n
    } else {
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    }
}

fn main() {
    fib(15)
}
{% end %}

## rune-languageserver

Rune now has basic editor support in [rune-vscode]. A Visual Studio Code
extension that adds syntax highlighting and integration with the Rune language server.
