A bit more than one month ago [I announced Rune on Reddit] ðŸ¥³. And the response
so far has been amazing.

A lot of *stuff* has happened since then, so in this post I'll detail some of
the developments since its initial announcement.

## Welcome to the playground

You might have noticed that this blog post contains runnable sections of code,
like this:

{% rune(footnote = "A code section you can edit") %}
const NAME = "Friend";

pub fn main() {
    println!("Hello, {}", NAME);
}
{% end %}

This is used to power the [**Rune playground**]. A place that allow you to fiddle
with Rune online and share code snippets with others*.

In order to accomplish this, we made sure Rune could compile and run on
[WebAssembly]. And [introduced a module] which provides an interface to the
compiler.

## Modules and visibility

We've taught rune to expand modules and respect visibility rules. This is a nice
feature that enabled better encapsulation and it brings the capabilities of Rune
more in line with Rust.

You can see basic modules in action with the following test case borrowed from
the [Rust reference book] (ignore the unused warnings ðŸ˜‰):

{% rune(footnote = "Basic modules and visibility smoke test", rune_config = '{"suppress_text_warnings": true}') %}
mod crate_helper_module {
    pub fn crate_helper() {}

    fn implementation_detail() {}
}

pub fn public_api() {}

pub mod submodule {
    use crate::crate_helper_module;

    pub fn my_method() {
        crate_helper_module::crate_helper();
    }

    fn my_implementation() {}

    mod test {
        fn test_my_implementation() {
            super::my_implementation();
        }
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    submodule::my_method();
}
{% end %}

This means that we've had to extend the existing bare bones system so that it
understands how to perform, and *cache* recursive imports and their visibility.
At this point it doesn't behave exactly like Rust. One example of this is that
conflicting wildcard imports simply override each other instead of [being marked
as ambiguous]:

{% rune(footnote = "The last wildcard import wins") %}
mod a { pub struct Foo; }
mod b { pub struct Foo; }
use {a::*, b::*};
pub fn main() { Foo is b::Foo }
{% end %}

But we do have the basic rules down [as outlined in the reference].

1. If an item is public, then it can be accessed externally from some module m
   if you can access all the item's ancestor modules from m. You can also
   potentially be able to name the item through re-exports. See below.
2. If an item is private, it may be accessed by the current module and its
   descendants.

The behavior of modules is also bound to be a bit buggy right now, and is likely
to change more in the future. Hopefully for the better!

## Macros

We've taught Rune how to parse and execute macros. Macros are compile-time
procedures which consumes one token stream and transforms it to produce another
in its place.

This is of course *a bit complicated*. You have to take care that macro
expansion happens in a manner that is well integrated into the rest of the
compilation. Too early, and the items produces in the macro for example can't
see imports. Too late, and it can't produce them. There are [still a few things]
that need to be figured out. But it's shaping up pretty well.

Rune support for macros is currently *experimental*. Macros are restricted to
native modules. This makes matters easier, because native modules are written in
Rust and are therefore compiled *before* any Rune program using them. Neatly
getting around the issue that you have to compile the macro before it can be
run.

We've tried to learn about macros from Rust. Parsing in Rune has been designed
in a way so that it can be re-used directly within macros, similarly to what you
get with the [`syn` crate]. We also provide our own version of the [`quote!`
macro] to ergonomically produce token streams.

The following is an example macro that comes with the `std::experiments` crate.
It translates "stringy math" into rune expressions:

```rust
use rune::ast;
use rune::macros;
use rune::{quote, Parser, Spanned, TokenStream};
use runestick::SpannedError;

/// Implementation for the `stringy_math!` macro.
pub(crate) fn stringy_math(stream: &TokenStream) -> runestick::Result<TokenStream> {
    let mut parser = Parser::from_token_stream(stream);

    let mut output = quote!(0);

    while !parser.is_eof()? {
        let op = parser.parse::<ast::Ident>()?;
        let arg = parser.parse::<ast::Expr>()?;

        output = match macros::resolve(op)?.as_ref() {
            "add" => quote!((#output) + #arg),
            "sub" => quote!((#output) - #arg),
            "div" => quote!((#output) / #arg),
            "mul" => quote!((#output) * #arg),
            _ => {
                return Err(SpannedError::msg(
                    op.span(),
                    "unsupported operation",
                ).into())
            }
        }
    }

    parser.eof()?;
    Ok(output.into_token_stream())
}
```

You can try it out below:

{% rune(footnote = "Use of the stringy_math! macro", experimental = true) %}
use std::experiments::stringy_math;

pub fn main() {
    let value = stringy_math!(add 10 sub 5);
    println!("result: {}", value);
}
{% end %}

Macros are intended to be a stable bedrock for language extension. To support
use-cases which can use a bit of custom syntax or behavior glued into a project.
A nice example of this in Rust is [Rocket], which uses macros to great effect to
improve the ergonomics of writing web services. The hopes are that macros can be
used to provide similar experiences where appropriate in Rune.

The current macro system is also being dogfooded to provide a couple of utility
macros that Rust developers would expect like `println!`, which will be covered
in the next section.

## `println!` and `FormatArgs`

In Rust, when you want to print something to stdout you can reach for the
`println!` macro.

```rust
println!("Hello {:>12}", "World");
```

The first argument in this macro is called a format string. And combined it
provides a convenient way for performing common text formatting operations in
Rust. Now Rune can also use a limited form of `println!`, and format arguments
in general.

{% rune(footnote = "Formatting with println!") %}
pub fn main() {
    println!("Hello {:>12}", "World");
}
{% end %}

To implement string formatting like this we've added `FormatArgs`. A type that
implements `Parse` that can be used to add message formatting to any macro. The
full implementation of the `println!` is simply using it to format a string
which is passed to `std::io::println`.

```rust
fn println_macro(stream: &TokenStream) -> Result<TokenStream> {
    let mut p = Parser::from_token_stream(stream);
    let args = p.parse_all::<macros::FormatArgs>()?;

    let expanded = args.expand()?;
    Ok(quote!(std::io::println(#expanded)).into_token_stream())
}
```

To accomplish this, `FormatArgs` is actually expanded into two internal macros:
* `#[builtin] template!(..)` which is the same macro produced by template
  strings.
* `#[builtin] format!(..)` which produces a `Format` value that conveniently
  implements [the `STRING_DISPLAY` protocol].

Strictly speaking, these expansions result in valid Rune. The `#[builtin]`
attribute modifies how the macros are looked up so that they are solely expanded
at compile time into the appropriate instructions. They are intended for
internal use only, so we'll probably restrict their use in the future. But for
now you can simply type out the equivalent code that is being generated to get a
better understanding for how they work ðŸ™ƒ.

{% rune(footnote = "Using the built-in template! and format! macros directly") %}
use std::io;

pub fn main() {
    io::println(#[builtin] template! {
        "Hello ",
        #[builtin] format! {
            "World",
            width = 12,
            align = right
        }
    });
}
{% end %}

This also means that the following macros now also support formatting:
* `panic!` to customize the panic message.
* `assert!` and `assert_eq!`.
* The newly introduced `format!`, which produces a string directly.

[the `STRING_DISPLAY` protocol]: https://rune-rs.github.io/book/template_literals.html#the-string_display-protocol

## constant evaluation

Work has been started to support *constant evaluation*. Usually all code is
compiled to target the [runestick virtual machine], but constant evaluation
introduces a separate interpreted mode that the compiler can run directly.

A limited subset of the language is currently available in constant contexts,
this includes functions and `const` items. Which can do the following:

* Numerical computations.
* Simple control flow through `if`, `while`, and `loop`.
* A number of binary operators.
* String operations and templates.
* ... and a bit more

Native functions are currently *not* visible during constant evaluation. This
could be enabled, but we still need to decide which scope to limit constant
evaluation to. I.e. do we want to be able to perform database requests during
constant evaluation? In practice this will probably be determined selectively.
Constant values are aggressively cached, so we should probably require a proof
obligation that they have no side effects and leave more complex uses with
potential side effects to macros.

Here's an example of what you can do today with constant evaluation:

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn greeting(name) {
    `Hello {name}`
}

/// Define a collection of predefined greetings.
const GREETINGS = [
    greeting("Stranger"),
    greeting("Jane"),
    greeting("John"),
    greeting("Mio"),
];

pub fn main() {
    let rng = rand::Pcg64::new();
    let greetings = GREETINGS;

	println(greetings[rng.int_range(0, greetings.len())]);
}
{% end %}

As a bonus, here's the [Fibonacci example used in the playground] as a constant
function. We only need to introduce `const` to the `fn` item for it to work.

{% rune(footnote = "Asynchronous programming using select", manually = true) %}
const fn fib(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        n
    } else {
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    fib(15)
}
{% end %}

## Better iterator support

Iterators have gotten a bit of love in that they are now represented as a single
consistent type called `Iterator`. This holds all the iterators transformation
methods like `map`, `filter`, and `rev`. Any function producing an iterator
should produce an instance of `Iterator`.

{% rune(footnote = "Reversing an iterator") %}
struct Foo {
    value,
}

pub fn main() {
    let values = [1, "foo", Foo { value: 42 }];

    for v in values.iter().rev() {
        println!("{:?}", v);
    }
}
{% end %}

We've also added two collect functions, `collect_vec` and `collect_object`.

{% rune(footnote = "Apply filter to an iterator and collecting the result") %}
struct Foo {
    value,
}

pub fn main() {
    let values = [1, "foo", Foo { value: 42 }];

    values.iter().filter(|v| v is Foo).collect_vec()
}
{% end %}

> Why two functions? Well, Rune doesn't have [type annotations to select the
> desired output type]. This solution should be considered preliminary, because
> this might be a good case where [gradual typing] might be used in the future.

## IDE Support

Work has been started to provide editor support through [rune-vscode]. A Visual
Studio Code extension that adds syntax highlighting and integration with the
Rune language server.

[rune-vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=udoprog.rune-vscode

![Showcasing go to definitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111092/93017349-32a28f00-f5c8-11ea-9301-5fcb586c89c8.gif)

While it works pretty well for now, don't get too excited. There's still a lot
of work to do. Next I'll detail the most important tasks yet to be done.

We absolutely [need to support external definition files] for this to work well.
Right now the language server simply includes all the native modules that
[happen to be bundled with Rune]. We don't see custom modules included
elsewhere. The solution is to have support for dynamically loading separate
declaration files which defines the content of native modules. Like with
[`.d.ts` files in TypeScript].

The language server is using the same compiler as Rune. Our hope is to be able
to maintain the same internals and avoid as much duplication as possible. To
accomplish this, we're looking closely at rust-analyzer. Specifically [their
approach to parsing] which provides better error resilience in order to give the
user a better experience when challenged with incomplete code. Something we
hopefully can work incrementally towards.
